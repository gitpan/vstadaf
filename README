This is a pTk based browser/converter for STADAF (STAndard DAtaset Flight).
STADAF is a Standard Dataset for the exchange of net airrates.
So it will only be useful for you if you are working at this business.

The module STADAF.pm provides an XBase-like interface for reading records.
Writing will be supported soon, but the stucture of such files is too stupid
having fun implementing it!!!

For more information about this strange structure goto: http://www.stadaf.com

If you are a commercial travel fellow you would love to use the Win32-binary
version "vstadaf-x.xx.zip" only.
